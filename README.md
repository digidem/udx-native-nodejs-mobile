# udx-native-nodejs-mobile

[NodeJS Mobile](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile) prebuilds for
[`udx-native`](https://github.com/holepunchto/udx-native)

## Working locally

### Requirements

- Android NDK
  - (optional) exported `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable

### General steps

Should be clear enough to follow the
[reusable workflow steps](https://github.com/digidem/nodejs-mobile-bare-prebuilds/blob/main/.github/workflows/prebuild.yml)
but in summary:

1. Download the npm tarball package and unzip e.g.
   ```
   npm pack udx-native@latest | xargs tar -zxvf
   ```
2. Navigate to unzipped directory:
   ```
   cd package
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Install
   [patched `cmake-napi`](https://github.com/digidem/cmake-napi-nodejs-mobile):
   ```
   npm install cmake-napi@github:digidem/cmake-napi-nodejs-mobile
   ```
5. Install [bare-make](https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-make) globally:
   ```
   npm install -g bare-make@latest
   ```
6. Generate, build and install:
   ```
   bare-make generate --platform android --arch arm64
   bare-make build
   bare-make install
   ```

## Creating a release

1. Navigate to the
   [Generate Prebuilds workflow](https://github.com/digidem/udx-native-nodejs-mobile/actions/workflows/prebuilds.yml)
2. Manually dispatch the worflow with the version you want to build, ensuring
   that "Publish Release" is checked.
